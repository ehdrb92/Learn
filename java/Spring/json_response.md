In a Spring Boot application, exporting JSON responses from a controller is straightforward, especially when using the `@RestController` annotation. This annotation is a convenience annotation that combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, meaning that data returned from each method in the controller is written directly to the response body as JSON, assuming you have the Jackson JSON library on your classpath, which is included by default in Spring Boot's starter web package.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to export JSON responses in a Spring Boot application with `@RestController`:

1. **Add Spring Web Dependency**: Ensure your Spring Boot application has the Spring Web dependency (`spring-boot-starter-web`) in your `pom.xml` or `build.gradle` file.

2. **Create a Model Class**: Define a model class that will represent the data structure of your JSON response. Spring Boot will automatically serialize instances of this class to JSON.

   ```java
   public class ResponseData {
       private String status;
       private Object data;
       // Constructors, getters, and setters
   }
   ```

3. **Create a RestController**: Annotate your controller class with `@RestController`. This tells Spring that all handler methods in this controller should have their return values written directly to the body of the response, converted to JSON.

   ```java
   import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
   import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

   @RestController
   public class MyController {

       @GetMapping("/data")
       public ResponseData getData() {
           ResponseData responseData = new ResponseData();
           responseData.setStatus("Success");
           responseData.setData(new DataObject()); // Assuming DataObject is another class you have defined
           return responseData;
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Configure Jackson (Optional)**: If you need to customize the JSON output, you can configure Jackson's `ObjectMapper` either globally through application properties or by providing your own `@Bean` configuration. For example, to format dates or to include non-null properties only.

5. **Run Your Application**: When you run your Spring Boot application and navigate to the endpoint (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/data`), Spring's HTTP message converters will automatically serialize your `ResponseData` object to JSON and write it to the response body.

6. **Testing**: You can test your endpoint using tools like Postman, cURL, or writing integration tests with `MockMvc` to ensure your JSON responses are correctly formatted and returned as expected.

Remember, Spring Boot's auto-configuration takes care of most of the heavy lifting, so you don't usually need to manually configure the serialization process unless you have specific requirements.
